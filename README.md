# AVL Tree Implementation in Java

This is a simple implementation of an AVL Tree in Java.
Contains the code listing from my
[blog page](https://iannis.io/blog/AVL-Trees/).

Consists of a file `AVLTree.java` that holds the implementation
of the AVL Tree class, and a file `Main.java` that can be used to test
the implementation.
